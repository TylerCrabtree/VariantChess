Project Name: Variant Chess

Description: This game is built from Xcode using objective c. The board will be smaller then the traditional chess, and there will be two ways of playing. Free play allows players to play freely with no restrictions on the pieces. Players can also choose a variant style, where the pieces will be restricted in movement. There is also a help button that has a list of instructions on how to play the game.
